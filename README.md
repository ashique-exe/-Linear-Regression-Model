# -Linear-Regression-Model
Supervised Learning - Linear Regression Model for predicting salaries based on years of experience.
    Data Preprocessing: The notebook imports necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.), loads the dataset, and explores the relationship between experience and salary.
    Data Visualization: Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between years of experience and salary.
    Model Training:
        The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
        A Linear Regression model is trained on the training data using scikit-learn.
    Model Evaluation: Predictions are made on both the training and test data, and the performance is evaluated using error metrics.
    Visualization of Results: The fitted regression line is plotted over the scatter plot of experience vs. salary for a visual representation of the model.
